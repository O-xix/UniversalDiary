# Universal Diary – Android Development Project (IB Computer Science SL)

This repository contains the design and implementation of the **Universal Diary**, a mobile journaling application created as part of the **IB Computer Science SL Internal Assessment**.  

## 📖 Project Overview
The **Universal Diary** is a multi-screen Android application designed to provide users with a personal space to log, view, and manage diary entries.  
- **Calendar-based navigation** allows users to move across monthly, weekly, and daily views.  
- **CRUD features** enable creating, editing, deleting, and commenting on diary entries.  
- Designed as a prototype for journaling, the system emphasizes **usability, persistence, and Android UI design**.  

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Java** – core application language  
- **Android Studio** – integrated development environment  
- **SQLite** – relational database for persistent local storage  
- **Android SDK** – UI components and activity lifecycle management  

## 📝 Features
- **Authentication**: login and sign-up system for user access  
- **Calendar Navigation**: switch between monthly, weekly, and daily views  
- **Diary Entries**: create, edit, delete, and view entries  
- **Comments**: add and view comments for each entry  
- **Persistence**: local data storage with SQLite  
- **Testing**: deployed on both Android Studio emulator and physical devices  

## 🔑 Key Skills Demonstrated
- Mobile application development with **Java & Android Studio**  
- Designing and implementing **multi-activity user interfaces**  
- Database integration with **SQLite** for persistent storage  
- Debugging, testing, and deploying to **real devices**  
- Iterative development of a functional prototype under project deadlines  

## 📌 Note
This was a **school project** — the emphasis was on **Android development, UI design, and local data persistence**. While functional as a prototype, it is not intended for production deployment.
